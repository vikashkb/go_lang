Let's start with a simple exercise. We will define 4 objects in Go, a `car` object, an `engine` object, a `maker` object, a `car_type` object and a `seat` object. Engine objects are like `v4/v6/turbo_v4 etc`. Maker objects are like `Mercedes, BMW, Lexus etc`. Car_type objects are like `sedan, minivan, SUV etc`. Seat objects are like `leather, faux leather, cloth etc`. And a car object has all of these underneath - `maker, engine, car_type, and seat`.
